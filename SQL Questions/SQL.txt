Question 1: Table to store data

To create a database on redshift, I integrated SQLWorkbench with my Redshift cluster and created the table as follows:

create table LH(
id integer not null,
property_address varchar(100),
buyer varchar(50),
seller varchar(50),
transaction_date timestamp,
property_id integer not null,
property_type varchar(4),
transaction_amount integer,
loan_amount integer,
lender varchar(50),
sqft integer not null,
year_built integer not null,
primary key(id));



Question 2: Count of fix-and-flip loans by lender by year
This is a simple query to find lenders against property that was part of the buy-sell transaction within 365 days:
This query joins LH(main table) with LH on the condition that lender,property,sqft, year etcare all the same
while the transaction date differs. And grouping this by the lender and year to project the count of such trandactions.



select a.lender, extract(year from a.transaction_date)as year, count(*) from LH a
join LH b
on a.property_id = b.property_id and a.property_type = b.property_type and
a.id != b.id and a.transaction_date != b.transaction_date and a.lender = b.lender
where a.transaction_date is not null and
b.transaction_date is not null and
a.sqft = b.sqft and a.year_built = b.year_built and 
(a.transaction_date - b.transaction_date) > 0 and 
(a.transaction_date - b.transaction_date) <=365 and
(a.loan_amount != 0 or b.loan_amount !=0)
group by a.lender, extract(year from a.transaction_date)
order by a.lender desc, extract(year from a.transaction_date);
